Treat input as a stream and find <<<>>> anywhere in it.

Multiple tables, multiple graphs

Named tables, named timelines, etc.

More widgets:

* Tree
* Timeline
* Line graph
* Map (cartography)
* Object inspector
* [Automatic Layout of Structured Hierarchical Reports](http://people.csail.mit.edu/ebakke/research/reportlayout_infovis2013.pdf)

Language semantics that allow nesting (timeline in a table, etc)

Put each handler in a separate file and read all handlers in the directory, so new ones can just be dropped in
