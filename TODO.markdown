Documentation

Treat input as a stream and find <<<>>> anywhere in it.

More widgets:

* Tree?
* Timeline?
* line graph?
* Map (cartography)?
* Object inspector

Language semantics that allow nesting (timeline in a table, etc)

Put each handler in a separate file and read all handlers in the directory, so new ones can just be dropped in
